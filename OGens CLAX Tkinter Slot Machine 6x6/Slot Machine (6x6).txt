# Slot Machine Game README (6x6 Version)

## Overview
This is an advanced Python-based slot machine game with a 6x6 grid, featuring 25 paylines, a variety of symbols, and engaging mechanics such as regular spins, free spins, a jackpot, extra credits, and an in-game store. Built using `tkinter` for the GUI and `secrets` for true randomness, the game offers an immersive experience with persistent player data, a leaderboard, and customizable bets. Players can win coins and credits, track stats, and purchase items, including a Mystery Prize and Bonus Spin Chance, to enhance gameplay.

## Game Features

### Game Setup
- **Grid**: 6 reels × 6 rows, displaying 36 symbols per spin.
- **Symbols**: 🍒 (Cherry), 🔔 (Bell), 🍋 (Lemon), 7️⃣ (Seven), ⭐ (Star), 💎 (Diamond, also the wild symbol), 🍉 (Watermelon), 🍊 (Orange).
- **Paylines**: 25 predefined paylines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and patterns like V-shape, zigzag, and W-shape) checked for wins.
- **Currency**: 
  - **Coins**: Used for betting and added to the balance when won.
  - **Credits**: Earned from winning paylines and used to purchase items in the store.
- **Persistence**: Player data (balance, jackpot, stats, extra spins, credits) is saved to `slot_machine_save.json`. Leaderboard data is saved to `leaderboard.json`.
- **Randomness**: Uses `secrets` module for cryptographically secure random symbol selection and credit generation.

### Betting and Spinning
- **Bet Adjustment**: Players set bets (1–100 coins) via a text entry or +/- buttons, limited by their balance. The bet can be adjusted without spinning.
- **Regular Spins**: Deduct the bet amount from the balance (unless using an extra spin) and increment the jackpot by 1 coin per bet (`JACKPOT_INCREMENT = 1`).
- **Extra Spins**: Can be used instead of regular spins, costing no coins and not contributing to the jackpot. Obtained by purchasing from the store (50 credits) or via the Mystery Prize (1-in-3 chance). Extra spins provide the same win opportunities as regular spins (paylines, extra credits, or free spins trigger).
- **Free Spins**: Triggered by six 💎 symbols in the middle row (row 4, index 3) or in any row if Bonus Spin Chance is active, or by purchasing from the store, granting 5 free spins (`FREE_SPINS = 5`). Free spins use the current bet for payouts but do not deduct from the balance.

### Payline Wins
When a payline is hit (i.e., all symbols in a payline are the same or include the wild symbol 💎), the payout is calculated as:  
**Payout = floor(Bet × Multiplier)** for the matching symbol, ensuring integer payouts.  
The multipliers are defined in the `PAYOUTS` dictionary (halved from original values):  
- 🍒: 1x  
- 🔔: 2x  
- 🍋: 1x  
- 7️⃣: 4x  
- ⭐: 3x  
- 💎: 6x  
- 🍉: 1x  
- 🍊: 1x  

For paylines with fewer than 6 symbols, the multiplier is halved (integer division).  
**Example**: If your bet is 10 coins and you hit a 6-symbol payline with 🍒 symbols, you win `floor(10 × 1) = 10 coins`. For a 3-symbol payline, you win `floor(10 × (1 // 2)) = 0 coins`.  

Multiple paylines can contribute to the total payout if multiple winning combinations are hit in a single spin. This applies to both **regular spins** and **free spins**.

### Extra Credits
For each winning payline, you receive **random extra credits** (between 1 and 50, generated using `secrets.randbelow(50) + 1`).  
These credits are added to your total credits, which can be used to purchase items in the store (e.g., extra spins, balance boosts, Mystery Prize, or Bonus Spin Chance).

**Example**: If you hit two paylines in a single spin (e.g., one 🍒 and one ⭐), you might earn `floor(10 × 1) = 10 coins` (🍒) + `floor(10 × 3) = 30 coins` (⭐) = 40 coins, plus, for example, 50 credits for the 🍒 payline and 30 credits for the ⭐ payline, totaling 80 credits.

### Free Spins Mode
- **Trigger**: Activated by six 💎 symbols in the middle row (row 4, index 3, checked via `check_bonus`) or in any row if Bonus Spin Chance is active (purchased for 100 credits, applies to the next spin only). Can also be triggered by purchasing "Free Spins Purchase" from the store.
- **Mechanics**: Grants 5 free spins, using the current bet (set before triggering) to calculate payouts. No coins are deducted from the balance.
- **Bonus Spin Chance**: When active, increases the chance of triggering free spins by checking all rows for six 💎 symbols (effectively a ~10% increased probability, as it checks 6 rows instead of 1). Resets after the next spin.
- **Winnings**: Payouts from paylines and extra credits (1–50 per winning payline) accumulate over the 5 spins. Total coins are added to the balance, and credits are added to the credit balance at the end.
- **Stats**: Each free spin increments the `spins` stat. Winning paylines increment the `wins` stat and add to `total_won` (payouts + extra credits). The `total_bet` stat is not incremented.
- **Limitations**: No additional free spins or jackpot checks occur during free spins.

### Jackpot
- **Base Value**: Starts at 1000 coins (`JACKPOT_BASE = 1000`).
- **Increment**: Increases by 1 coin per bet in regular spins (`JACKPOT_INCREMENT = 1`).
- **Win Condition**: 1-in-1000 chance (`secrets.randbelow(1000) == 0`) for bets of 1–100 coins during regular spins (not free spins or extra spins).
- **Payout**: Awards the entire jackpot, which resets to 1000 coins after a win. The balance is updated, and the win is recorded in stats and the leaderboard.
- **Visuals**: Winning the jackpot highlights all reel symbols in gold.

### In-Game Store
Players can spend credits to purchase items, enhancing gameplay:
- **Extra Spin** (50 credits): Adds 1 extra spin, usable without deducting coins, offering a chance to win paylines, extra credits, or trigger free spins.
- **Balance Boost** (100 credits): Adds 100 coins to the balance.
- **Jackpot Boost** (200 credits): Increases the jackpot by 500 coins.
- **Free Spins Purchase** (250 credits): Triggers 5 free spins immediately.
- **Mystery Prize** (75 credits): Awards a random reward: 50–100 coins, 50–100 credits, or 1 extra spin (determined using `secrets.randbelow(3)` for type and `secrets.randbelow(51) + 50` for coin/credit amounts).
- **Bonus Spin Chance** (100 credits): Increases the chance of triggering free spins by checking all rows for six 💎 symbols on the next spin (effectively ~10% higher probability).
- **Mechanics**: Select an item from the store listbox and click "Buy Item." The purchase deducts credits and applies the effect. Insufficient credits trigger an error message.

### Stats and Leaderboard
- **Stats Tracking**:
  - **Spins**: Incremented for each regular, extra, or free spin.
  - **Wins**: Incremented for spins with at least one winning payline or a jackpot win.
  - **Total Won**: Sum of all coins and credits won from paylines, jackpots, and Mystery Prizes.
  - **Total Bet**: Sum of coins bet in regular spins (not extra or free spins).
  - **Win Rate**: Calculated as `(wins / spins) × 100` (0% if no spins).
- **Leaderboard**: Stores the top 5 high scores (balance) with player names in `leaderboard.json`. Updated on game quit, when the balance reaches zero (game over), or after a jackpot win.
- **Display**: Stats are shown in the GUI, and the leaderboard is accessible via a button, displayed in a pop-up.
